Great interviews don't happen by accident. They result from preparation, curiosity, and the ability to listen beyond the prepared talking points.

## Preparation is Everything

Before sitting down with any expert, invest time in understanding:

- Their career trajectory and key decisions
- The current state of their industry
- Recent controversies or debates they're engaged in
- What they care about beyond their official role

## The Questions That Matter

The best questions often begin with "How did you..." or "What surprised you..." They invite stories rather than soundbites.

## Building Trust

Expert interviews are relationships, not transactions. The goal isn't just to extract information—it's to create a conversation that both parties find valuable.
