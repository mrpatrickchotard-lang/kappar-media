Artificial intelligence isn't just changing how media is made—it's redefining what media companies can be. From automated transcription to personalized content feeds, AI tools are becoming essential infrastructure.

## The New Workflow

Modern media operations blend human creativity with machine efficiency:

- **Research**: AI-assisted fact-checking and source discovery
- **Production**: Automated editing and formatting
- **Distribution**: Algorithmic optimization for multiple platforms
- **Engagement**: Personalized newsletter curation

## Opportunities and Risks

While AI enables smaller teams to produce at scale, it also raises questions about originality, bias, and the value of human perspective. The media companies that thrive will be those that use AI as an amplifier, not a replacement.
